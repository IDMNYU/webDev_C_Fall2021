##### ðŸ’¾   Pair programming presentation net.art project
With a partner, students will choose 1 artwork or artist from either the [Rhizome's net.art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) or [Chronus Art Center's last three exhibitions](http://www.chronusartcenter.org/en/exhibition/) to present to the class in a 7 minute presentation. Students should share a brief introduction to the artists and their thoughts on the expirence of the artwork. 
* You MUST create your [slide deck](https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+deck&oq=slide+deck&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.3609j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) using HTML, CSS + host on your class site. Each slide can be a relative link to another html page or a more sophisticated system if you choose. Use an external styling sheet to keep the styling of your presentation uniform. 
* Your slide deck website must include:
  * A clear wireframe and plan for execution
  * it's own directory + file path linked from your class site home page
  * Multiple HTML pages controlled by 1 external styling sheet
  * Flex or Grid Display on some portion of the page(s)
  * Some navigation with links to relative file path to go to the next "slide"
  * at least one instance of CSS [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) + one [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)
  * At least three pictutres and an "images" or "assets" directory to hold your media. An "pages" or "slides" directory to hold your pages.
* Post a link to your net.art Presentation Web Site (Slide Deck) 
* Remember this is a presentation to the class. We should hear from both people in the partnership. 

#### Assignment due Saturday:
Spend time this weekend on the above sites with the artworks. Pick two works you are most interested in and post your list of top picks to Discord server by 8pm EST Saturday. 

#### Assignment for Tuesay:
* Use the stream to find other folks who liked similar works and pair yourselves up accordingly.  If you would like to work with someone in particular - reach out to them and then dm or email me. 
* Be prepared to meet with your partner. Look at the work together and talk about the expirence of looking at it. Make notes - this conversation will lead to your talking points in the presentation. Take screen shots and/or recordings of yourself interacting with the work. If you each have a different experience of the piece - great! Show us and talk about the differences. Not simply "i liked it, s/he didn't" but actually what you each materially experienced on your different screens. 

#### Presentations due during class Monday the 18th. You will have all of Tuesday and Wednesday the 13th to work with your partner in class.
